      <p>
        Mao is the greatest card game in existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        To play Mao, you need a group of awesome people and one deck of standard playing cards per two to four people in the group (a minimum of two decks). Jokers may be included (two per deck), depending on the decided rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of Mao is to get rid of all of your cards.

        <u>Penalties</u>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The heart of Mao lies in its dynamic rules and avoiding the penalties for breaking them. The rule breaker must take one card as the penalty, unless the rule states otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be rules that are unenforceable through a one card penalty and are instead only enforceable through an <b>honor system</b>.</p>

        <u>New Players</u>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <b>New players must never be introduced to these rules, but instead must figure the rules out themselves.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is recommended that games with new players start with basic Mao rules, and then make their way up to advanced, adding, and eventually more rule sets.
